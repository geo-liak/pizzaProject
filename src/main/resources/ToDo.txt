ToDo - List of things that need to be done

May 8th:
FOR GG:

- In all the forms we will have to describe the fields, as I did in /orderproducts/1/edit?id=1

- Unify style across all pages of the site.

- Connect CRUDs with admin interface.


FOR GL:

- Rewview page

- Check number on cart after login.

- Orders: field date is not saved in db. ==> Check if fixed.

- CHAT

- PAYPAL

- Customer change password

- In the registration form, when there are errors we don't get the messages with red color.

- When user logged in and clicks the "Pizza Margherita" (/home) link he goes to menu not home. 
>>>> It's not a bug, it's a feature!!! I did this on purpose, We need to discuss about this.

- We should replace all the products with pizzas only.

- in login page change the input type from "text" to "email" ==> Do we really need the username to be email?
