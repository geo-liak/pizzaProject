ToDo - List of things that need to be done

May 8th:
FOR GG:

- In all the forms we will have to describe the fields, as I did in /orderproducts/1/edit?id=1

- Unify style across all pages of the site.

- Connect CRUDs with admin interface.


FOR GL:

- Rewview page

- Check number on cart after login.

- Orders: field date is not saved in db. ==> Check if fixed.


***********
* PENDING *

- CHAT

- PAYPAL

- Customer change password

- In the registration form, when there are errors we don't get the messages with red color.

- In the menu, if we change any quantity to zero by typing the number and we press the "add to cart", the new quantity is not saved.

- We should replace all the products with pizzas only.

- in login page change the input type from "text" to "email" ==> Do we really need the username to be email?
