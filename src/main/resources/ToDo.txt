ToDo - List of things that need to be done

- in login page change the input type from "text" to "email" ==> Do we really need the username to be email?

- sessionStorage and localStorage

- Orders: field date is not saved in db. ==> Check if fixed.

- In all the forms we will have to describe the fields, as I did in /orderproducts/1/edit?id=1

- We should replace all the products with pizzas only.

- In the registration form, when there are errors we don't get the messages with red color.

- Unify style across all pages of the site.

- CRUD Users ==> Update still has problems & user roles.

- Address CRUD???????

- Customer change password


SOS: If user has proceeds to checkout but he is not logged in, we should redirect him to /login first and then to /review.
